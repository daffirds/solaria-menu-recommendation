# Solaria Personalized Menu Recommendation System üçú

This project builds a recommendation system for menu items in *Solaria* restaurants based on customer ratings using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

## Project Structure
- `data/` : datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks with exploratory analysis and experiments.
- `plot/` : Saved plots.

## Methods
- SVD-based matrix factorization
- Iterative imputation for missing ratings
- Folding-in method for new users in latent factor models (SVD model)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daffirds/solaria-menu-recommendation.git
   cd solaria-menu-recommendation
````

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/svd_recommendation.ipynb
   ```
3. Run **all cells** in the notebook to set up the recommendation system.

4. Input your ratings for the 20 menu items by creating a list, for example:

```python
rating = [0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, ..., 2]  # replace ... with your ratings until all 20 items
```

5. Run the recommendation function:

```python
show_recom(rating)
```

This will display the recommended menu items based on your ratings.
